# password-generator

A simple program to generate passwords of specified length and using specified character sets. 
Purpose was to learn about vectors, throwing exceptions, and overall become re-familiarized with C++ after extensive coursework in Java.
Program can be further improved by developing a cleaner way of looping/quitting, more code abstraction to functions from main(), and switching the design to a class-based approach for a password.
